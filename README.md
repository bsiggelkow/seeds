== Seeds
Seeds is a simple library of reusable Cucumber steps that builds
on the steps provided by Capybara.

== Motivation
Writing Cucumber steps can be hard. Every time I write one, I end up with two conclusions:
1. Someone else has probably written something similar, and may, or may not, have talked about it online, and
2. The step that I just wrote could be probably be used by other folks if I carefully structure the step,
3. I really should capture these general-purpose steps in a place where other folks can use them and contribute back.
